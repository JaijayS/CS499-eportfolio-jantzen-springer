# CS499 Capstone ePortfolio  
**Jantzen Springer – B.S. Computer Science, SNHU**

Welcome to my Computer Science Capstone ePortfolio. This repository presents key projects I plan to enhance as part of my final capstone course at Southern New Hampshire University. Each section highlights core competencies I’ve developed throughout the program—from software engineering to data structures and database systems.

## Portfolio Contents

### [Professional Self-Assessment](self-assessment.md)  
A reflective overview of how this program has shaped my technical growth, influenced my professional values, and prepared me for opportunities in software development.

### [Code Review Video](code-review.md)  
A walkthrough of each project’s goals and planned enhancements, with commentary on design choices and expected improvements.

### [Software Engineering Artifact](software/narrative.md)  
An animal-themed text-based game implemented in Python. Planned enhancements include modular code design, item collection logic, win conditions, and cleaner input handling.

### [Algorithms & Data Structures Artifact](algorithms/narrative.md)  
A C++ course planner application that reads data from a CSV and uses a hash table for storage. Planned updates include implementing a custom quicksort, benchmarking alternative data structures, and modularizing the code.

### [Database Artifact](database/narrative.md)  
A full-stack Spring Boot web application modeled after the original DriverPass business document. This application will include user roles (Admin, Student, Teacher), appointment scheduling, vehicle management, and secure MySQL database integration.
