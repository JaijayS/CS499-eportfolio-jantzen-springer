# Code Review Video

In this code review video, I outline the purpose of each original artifact and walk through the specific enhancements I plan to make to improve structure, usability, and overall software quality. Each project is linked below.

## Project Artifacts & Expected Enhancements

---

### Text-Based Game (Software Engineering)
- **GitHub:** [View Project](https://github.com/JaijayS/CS499-eportfolio-jantzen-springer/tree/main/software)
- **Language:** Python (single file)
- **Original:** A basic text-driven adventure game where a player moves around a grid.
- **Planned Enhancements:**
  - Modularize the code by breaking it into classes for `Player`, `Item`, `Room`, and `Game`.
  - Add an item collection system with a win condition (e.g., collect all items before entering the final room).
  - Improve user input handling and validation.
  - Refactor game loop for better readability and reusability.

### Course Planner (Algorithms & Data Structures)
- **GitHub:** [View Project](https://github.com/JaijayS/CS499-eportfolio-jantzen-springer/tree/main/algorithms)
- **Language:** C++
- **Original:** A terminal-based planner using a hash table to store and search course data from a CSV.
- **Planned Enhancements:**
  - Implement a custom quicksort algorithm instead of using `std::sort`, to demonstrate sorting logic explicitly.
  - Add a benchmarking tool to compare hash table vs. BST performance for searches.
  - Improve user interface clarity by separating course info into cleaner blocks.
  - Add modular files for sorting, data loading, and search logic.

### DriverPass Web App (Database & Full Stack)
- **GitHub:** [View Project](https://github.com/JaijayS/CS499-eportfolio-jantzen-springer/tree/main/database)
- **Language/Stack:** Java Spring Boot, Thymeleaf, MySQL
- **Original:** Business Requirements Document for a driving test preparation platform.
- **Planned Enhancements:**
  - Build out the full web application based on the BRD.
  - Implement user roles (student, teacher, admin) with secure authentication.
  - Add appointment scheduling, vehicle checkout, and course enrollment features.
  - Create dashboards with CRUD access to users, vehicles, and courses.
