# Enhancement One: Software Design/Engineering

Original artifact:
Enhanced: artifact: 

## 1. Artifact Overview

The artifact is different than previously mentioned but provides much better alignment to the Milestone 2 enhancement. **TextBasedGame** was originally written in **Python**. It has now been reformatted into the **Java programming language**, showcasing improved software design principles. The original program had no clear structure and consisted of a single `.py` file.

The transition to Java introduced modularity by splitting the code into distinct **packages and classes**, such as `Player`, `GameMap`, `Room`, and `GameOverException`. This refactoring enhances **maintainability**, **readability**, and **extensibility**. Additionally, Java’s strong typing and object-oriented features enabled better **encapsulation of game logic**, clearer **separation of concerns**, and more **robust error handling** compared to the original Python script.

## 2. Justification for Inclusion

This project demonstrates my ability to **refactor a previously unstructured and disorganized project**. It highlights my growing proficiency in **software design principles** and **object-oriented programming (OOP)**.

I incorporated modular design by restructuring the original single Python script into well-organized Java classes and packages. Each class was given a **clear responsibility** to improve readability and maintainability. This project is a strong example of how I transformed a basic concept into a **structured, scalable application**.

### Key Improvements:
- Restructured flat script into modular classes (`Room`, `Player`, `GameMap`, etc.)
- Applied OOP concepts like **inheritance**, **abstraction**, and **encapsulation**
- Improved separation of concerns for better debugging and scalability
- Built exception handling (e.g., `GameOverException`) for game-ending logic

## 3. Outcome Alignment

Yes, I met the course outcomes I planned for this enhancement.

Refactoring the unstructured Python script into a modular Java project helped me apply **object-oriented principles** and **software design techniques** like **abstraction** and **encapsulation**. Writing clear, organized code and documentation showed my ability to **communicate technical ideas effectively**.

I don’t have any changes to my outcome coverage plan currently.

## 4. Reflection

After reviewing the original code, I figured out which **objects** I needed and what they should do in the game. I learned how to **break things up into smaller, organized classes** that each handled a specific part of the program.

One challenge was making sure **everything connected correctly** after moving logic out of one file. But it reinforced my understanding of **object-oriented programming** and how **classes interact** with one another.

This project made me more confident in writing code that is **modular**, **scalable**, and **easier to maintain**.
