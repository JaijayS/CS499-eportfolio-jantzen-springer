# Professional Self-Assessment

Completing the Computer Science program and developing this ePortfolio has given me a strong foundation in software development, problem solving, and real-world application of technical skills. Through this process, I’ve grown not just as a coder, but as someone who can approach a problem, design a solution, and deliver working systems that meet user needs. The projects I've worked on helped me define my professional goals and showed me that I enjoy building useful tools that combine backend logic with clean interfaces and real data.

Throughout the program, I’ve had the opportunity to work both independently and in collaborative environments. Whether it was contributing to a shared GitHub repo or giving and receiving feedback on designs and code structure, I learned how to adapt my communication for technical and non-technical stakeholders. Being able to explain logic clearly and work through design decisions with others is something I’ve carried into each of my projects.

From a technical standpoint, I’ve become confident in using data structures and algorithms to solve practical problems. Whether I was optimizing a search function in my course planning app or restructuring game logic for cleaner control flow, I consistently applied these concepts to make my work more efficient and maintainable. I also gained hands-on experience with core software engineering practices, including object-oriented design, modularization, and test-driven development — and became comfortable working with databases, both in raw SQL and using frameworks like Spring JPA.

Security was also part of my learning, especially when working with authentication and user data in full stack applications. I learned how to properly hash passwords, manage roles and permissions, and protect routes in web applications using Spring Security.

The artifacts I chose for this portfolio show a wide range of my abilities. The **Text-Based Game** demonstrates my understanding of software design and how to refactor messy code into an object-oriented program. The **Clock and Calculator** projects show how I’ve applied algorithms, control structures, and interface logic in both console and GUI applications. Finally, the **DriverPass Spring Boot application** ties everything together, showing how I’ve worked with databases, user management, role-based dashboards, and backend/frontend integration to build something that resembles a real product.

Together, these projects reflect who I am as a developer: someone who is practical, organized, and committed to writing clean, useful code that solves problems. This portfolio is a snapshot of my skills as I begin my career in computer science, and I’m ready to keep learning and take on new challenges in the field.
